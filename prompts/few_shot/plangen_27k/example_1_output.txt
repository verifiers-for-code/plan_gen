To create an action plan for implementing the multiply_numbers function, I'll break down the task into clear, logical steps. The plan should guide the model through the process without providing the full solution. I'll focus on:

1. Understanding the function signature and parameters
2. Explaining the operation to be performed
3. Handling different input types (int and float)
4. Returning the correct result
5. Considering edge cases or potential errors
</thinking>

Action Plan:
1. Define the function with two parameters: num1 and num2
2. Ensure the function can accept both integers and floats
3. Multiply num1 and num2 using the * operator
4. Return the result of the multiplication
5. No need for type checking as Python handles int and float multiplication automatically
6. No need for error handling as multiplication is valid for all number combinations
