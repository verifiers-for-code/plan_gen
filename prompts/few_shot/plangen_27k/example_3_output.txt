To create an effective action plan for this problem, I need to break down the solution into clear, logical steps that guide the implementation without providing the full code. The plan should cover:
1. Parsing the input string into words
2. Setting up a loop to process each word
3. Implementing the case-insensitive comparison logic for prefixes, suffixes, and substrings
4. Applying the capitalization rules based on the conditions
5. Assembling the final result
</thinking>

Action Plan:
1. Split the input string into a list of words.
2. Create an empty list to store the processed words.
3. Iterate through each word in the list of words:
    a. Convert the current word to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison.
    b. Check if the lowercase word meets any of the following conditions:
        - Starts with any of the prefixes (case-insensitive)
        - Ends with any of the suffixes (case-insensitive)
        - Contains any of the substrings (case-insensitive)
    c. If any condition is met:
        - Capitalize the original word (first letter uppercase, rest lowercase)
    d. If no condition is met:
        - Convert the original word to lowercase
    e. Add the processed word to the list of processed words.
4. Join the list of processed words with spaces to create the final string.
5. Return the final string.

Note: Use appropriate string methods for comparisons and transformations.
Be careful to perform case-insensitive comparisons correctly.
