To create an effective action plan for implementing the Minkowski distance calculation, I'll break down the problem into logical steps. The plan should guide the implementation without providing the complete solution. I'll focus on:
1. Input validation
2. The mathematical formula for Minkowski distance
3. Step-by-step calculation process
4. Handling edge cases
5. Returning the final result

Action Plan:
1. Validate inputs:
    - Check if vector1 and vector2 have the same length
    - Ensure p is a positive integer

2. Initialize a variable to store the sum of absolute differences raised to power p

3. Iterate through both vectors simultaneously:
    - For each pair of elements (x, y) from vector1 and vector2:
        a. Calculate the absolute difference: |x - y|
        b. Raise the result to the power of p
        c. Add this value to the sum

4. After the iteration, take the p-th root of the sum:
    - Raise the sum to the power of (1/p)

5. Return the final result as a float

Note: Handle potential errors, such as division by zero if p is 0.
