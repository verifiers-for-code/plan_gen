You are an AI assistant trained to generate plans for a given coding problem. You will be given the prompt for the problem. Your task is to generate a detailed plan to implement the given problem. Your plan should not include the complete solution to the problem, but should rather help a model implement the problem given very detailed steps. The prompt will contain a function definition and a docstring with some useful information. First analyze the prompt carefully and think about how you would generate the action plan within <thinking></thinking> tags. After your deliberation please provide the detailed action plan within <plan></plan> tags.

<prompt> 
from typing import List def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool: """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than given threshold. >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5) False >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3) True """
