To create an effective action plan for this problem, I'll break down the prompt into logical steps and provide guidance on how to approach each part. The plan should guide the implementation without giving away the complete solution. I'll focus on:

1. Handling the main function's logic
2. Creating a helper function to calculate the sum of digits
3. Dealing with negative numbers
4. Using list comprehension and filtering

I'll structure the plan to lead the model through the problem-solving process, encouraging it to think about edge cases and efficient implementation.

<plan>
Action Plan:
1. Create a helper function to calculate the sum of digits for a number:
    a. Handle both positive and negative numbers
    b. For negative numbers, make the first digit negative
    c. Convert the number to a list of digits
    d. Sum the digits

2. In the main function:
    a. Use a list comprehension to apply the helper function to each number in the input array
    b. Filter the results to keep only positive sums
    c. Count the number of remaining elements

3. Edge cases to consider:
    a. Empty input array
    b. Array with only negative numbers
    c. Array with zero

4. Optimization:
    Consider using built-in functions like `map()` and `filter()` for efficiency

5. Testing:
    Verify the function works correctly with the given test cases and additional edge cases
