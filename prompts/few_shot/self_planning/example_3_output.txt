1. Initialize a counter for numbers with sum of digits > 0.
2. Iterate through each number in the input array.
3. For each number, calculate the sum of its digits:
   a. Convert the number to its absolute value.
   b. Sum the digits using modulo and integer division.
   c. If the original number was negative, subtract twice the first digit.
4. If the sum of digits is greater than 0, increment the counter.
5. Return the final count.
