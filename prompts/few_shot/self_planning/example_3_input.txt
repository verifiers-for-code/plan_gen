You are an AI assistant trained to generate plans for a given coding problem. You will be given the prompt for the problem. Your task is to generate a detailed plan to implement the given problem. Your plan should not include the complete solution to the problem, but should rather help a model implement the problem given very detailed steps. The prompt will contain a function definition and a docstring with some useful information. First analyze the prompt carefully and think about how you would generate the action plan within <thinking></thinking> tags. After your deliberation please provide the detailed action plan within <plan></plan> tags.

<prompt>
def count_nums(arr): """ Write a function count_nums which takes an array of integers and returns the number of elements which has a sum of digits > 0. If a number is negative, then its first signed digit will be negative: e.g. -123 has signed digits -1, 2, and 3. >>> count_nums([]) == 0 >>> count_nums([-1, 11, -11]) == 1 >>> count_nums([1, 1, 2]) == 3 """
