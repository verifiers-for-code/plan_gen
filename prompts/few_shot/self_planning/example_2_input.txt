You are an AI assistant trained to generate plans for a given coding problem. You will be given the prompt for the problem. Your task is to generate a detailed plan to implement the given problem. Your plan should not include the complete solution to the problem, but should rather help a model implement the problem given very detailed steps. The prompt will contain a function definition and a docstring with some useful information. First analyze the prompt carefully and think about how you would generate the action plan within <thinking></thinking> tags. After your deliberation please provide the detailed action plan within <plan></plan> tags.

<prompt> 
from typing import List, Tuple def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]) -> Tuple[float, float]: """ From a supplied list of numbers (of length at least two) select and return two that are the closest to each other and return them in order (smaller number, larger number). >>> find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2]) (2.0, 2.2) >>> find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0]) (2.0, 2.0) ""
