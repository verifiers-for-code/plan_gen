To create an effective action plan for this problem, I'll break down the prompt into logical steps that guide the implementation without giving away the complete code. The plan should focus on the algorithm's core ideas: comparing each pair of numbers, tracking the smallest difference, and returning the closest pair. I'll structure the action plan, providing clear steps that a model can follow to implement the solution.

<plan>
Action Plan:
1. Initialize variables to store the closest pair and their distance:
    - Set closest_pair to None
    - Set distance to None

2. Implement nested loops to compare each number with every other number:
    - Outer loop: Iterate through the list using enumerate() to get index and element
    - Inner loop: Iterate through the list again using enumerate()
    
3. Inside the inner loop, add a condition to avoid comparing a number with itself:
    - Check if the indices from outer and inner loops are different

4. Calculate the absolute difference between the current pair of numbers

5. Handle the first comparison separately:
    - If distance is None, update distance and closest_pair

6. For subsequent comparisons:
    - If the new distance is smaller than the current distance:
        - Update distance
        - Update closest_pair (ensure smaller number comes first)

7. After both loops complete, return the closest_pair
