1. Sort the input list of numbers.
2. Initialize variables to store the minimum difference and the closest pair.
3. Iterate through the sorted list, comparing adjacent elements.
4. Update the minimum difference and closest pair if a smaller difference is found.
5. Return the closest pair as a tuple (smaller number, larger number).
