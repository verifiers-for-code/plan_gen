Create a nested loop to print every combination of numbers between 0-9, excluding any combination that contains the number 5. Additionally, exclude any combination that contains a repeating digit. Implement the solution without using any built-in functions or libraries to check for repeating digits.

Here is an example of a nested loop in Python to print every combination of numbers between 0-9, excluding any combination that contains the number 5 or repeating digits: python for i in range(10): # First digit for j in range(10): # Second digit for k in range(10): # Third digit # Checking for the conditions if i != 5 and j != 5 and k != 5 and i != j and i != k and j != k: print(i, j, k)  This code will generate and print every combination of three digits between 0-9 that do not contain the number 5 and do not have any repeating digits.
