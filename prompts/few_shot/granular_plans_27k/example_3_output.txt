<thinking>
To generate a detailed plan for implementing this function, I need to break down the problem into clear, logical steps. The function needs to process a string, apply specific conditions to each word, and return a modified string. The key aspects to consider are:

1. Handling the input string and lists
2. Processing each word individually
3. Applying the conditions (prefixes, suffixes, substrings) case-insensitively
4. Capitalizing or lowercasing words based on the conditions
5. Reconstructing the final string

I'll create a step-by-step plan that guides the implementation without providing the actual code. The plan will be detailed enough for a model to follow and implement the function correctly.

<plan>
1. Split the input string into a list of words
   - Use the appropriate string method to split the string into individual words

2. Create an empty list to store the processed words
   - This list will hold the words after applying the capitalization rules

3. Iterate through each word in the list of words:
   a. Convert the current word to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison
   b. Check if the lowercase word meets any of the following conditions:
      - Starts with any prefix in the 'prefixes' list (case-insensitive)
      - Ends with any suffix in the 'suffixes' list (case-insensitive)
      - Contains any substring in the 'substrings' list (case-insensitive)
   c. If any condition is met:
      - Capitalize the original word (first letter uppercase, rest lowercase)
   d. If no condition is met:
      - Convert the original word to lowercase
   e. Add the processed word (capitalized or lowercase) to the new list

4. Join the processed words back into a single string
   - Use a space as the separator between words

5. Return the final processed string

Additional implementation details:
- For checking prefixes: Use a loop or list comprehension to check if the lowercase word starts with any lowercase prefix
- For checking suffixes: Use a loop or list comprehension to check if the lowercase word ends with any lowercase suffix
- For checking substrings: Use a loop or list comprehension to check if any lowercase substring is in the lowercase word
- Use the appropriate string methods for lowercase conversion, capitalization, and joining words
- Ensure that the function handles empty input strings and empty lists for prefixes, suffixes, and substrings correctly
