To create a detailed plan for implementing the multiply_numbers function, I need to break down the problem into clear, actionable steps. The plan should guide the model through the implementation process without providing the actual code. I'll focus on:

1. Understanding the function parameters and their types
2. Explaining the operation to be performed
3. Addressing the return value and its type
4. Considering edge cases or potential issues
5. Providing guidance on testing the function

I'll structure the plan to be as explicit and detailed as possible, ensuring that a model following these instructions would be able to implement the function correctly.

<plan>
1. Understand the function parameters:
   - The function takes two parameters: num1 and num2
   - Both parameters can be either integers or floating-point numbers
   - No type checking or conversion is required, as Python can handle multiplication of mixed types (int and float)

2. Implement the multiplication operation:
   - Use the multiplication operator (*) to multiply num1 and num2
   - Assign the result of this operation to a variable (you can name it 'result' or 'product')

3. Return the result:
   - Immediately return the result of the multiplication
   - No need for intermediate variables or additional processing

4. Consider edge cases:
   - The function should handle negative numbers correctly
   - The function should work with floating-point numbers, including numbers with decimal places
   - Zero as an input should be handled correctly (anything multiplied by zero is zero)

5. Implement error handling:
   - No explicit error handling is required for this function
   - Python will automatically raise a TypeError if non-numeric types are passed as arguments

6. Optimize the function:
   - The function is already as simple and efficient as possible
   - No further optimization is needed
