To generate a detailed plan for implementing the Minkowski distance calculation, I'll break down the solution into logical steps. The plan should guide the model through the process of implementing the function, starting with input validation, then the core calculation, and finally returning the result. I'll make sure to include explanations for each step to help the model understand the reasoning behind the implementation.

Key points to address:
1. Input validation
2. The mathematical formula for Minkowski distance
3. Using zip() to pair elements from both vectors
4. Applying the formula using a list comprehension
5. Calculating the final result
6. Handling potential errors

I'll structure the plan to be clear and concise, providing step-by-step instructions that a model can follow to implement the function correctly.

<plan>
1. Start by validating the input:
   - Check if the lengths of vector1 and vector2 are equal.
   - If not, raise a ValueError with an appropriate error message.

2. Implement the core calculation:
   - Use the Minkowski distance formula: (Î£|x_i - y_i|^p)^(1/p)
   - Break this down into steps:
     a. Calculate the absolute difference between corresponding elements
     b. Raise each difference to the power of p
     c. Sum all these values
     d. Take the p-th root of the sum

3. Use zip() to pair elements from vector1 and vector2:
   - This allows easy iteration over corresponding elements from both vectors

4. Implement the calculation using a list comprehension:
   - Inside the comprehension:
     a. Subtract corresponding elements (x - y)
     b. Take the absolute value of the difference (abs())
     c. Raise the result to the power of p (** p)

5. Sum the results of the list comprehension using the sum() function

6. Calculate the final result:
   - Take the p-th root of the sum by raising it to the power of (1/p)

7. Return the calculated distance as a float

8. Implement error handling:
   - Use a try-except block to catch potential errors (e.g., TypeError for invalid input types)
   - Raise appropriate exceptions with informative error messages

9. Consider adding a check to ensure p is a positive integer, raising a ValueError if it's not
