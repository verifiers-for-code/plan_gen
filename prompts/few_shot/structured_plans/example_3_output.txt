This problem requires implementing a function `below_zero` that takes a list of integers representing deposit and withdrawal operations on a bank account. The main objective is to determine if the account balance ever falls below zero during these operations.
Key considerations:
1. The account starts with a zero balance.
2. Positive integers represent deposits, negative integers represent withdrawals.
3. We need to keep track of the running balance as we process each operation.
4. The function should return True as soon as the balance becomes negative.
5. If the balance never goes below zero, the function should return False.
Edge cases to consider:
1. An empty list of operations (should return False as the balance never goes below zero).
2. A list with only positive numbers (should return False).
3. A list with only negative numbers (likely to return True unless it's empty).
4. A list where the balance goes to exactly zero but not below (should return False).

<plan>
Variable Initialization:
- balance: int (initialized to 0)
Objective: Determine if the account balance ever falls below zero during a series of deposit and withdrawal operations.

Implementation:
Iteration: Iterate through each operation in the input list 'operations'
Conditional Statements:
- If balance < 0: return True
Calculations: Add each operation to the balance (balance += op)
Updates: Update balance after each operation

Edge Cases:
Invalid Inputs:
- Empty list: Return False (balance never goes below zero)
- Non-integer values in the list: Not specified in the prompt, but should be considered for robust implementation
Boundary Conditions:
- Balance exactly zero: Continue processing (do not return True)
- First operation brings balance below zero: Return True immediately
Special Cases:
- List with only positive numbers: Will always return False
- List with only negative numbers: Likely to return True unless empty
