This problem requires us to separate groups of nested parentheses from a given string into a list of separate strings. Let's analyze the key aspects:
1. Main objective: The function needs to take a string containing multiple groups of nested parentheses and return a list of strings, where each string represents a balanced group of parentheses.
2. Key considerations:
   a. Balanced parentheses: Each group should have matching opening and closing parentheses.
   b. Separation: Groups should not be nested within each other.
   c. Ignore spaces: The function should disregard any spaces in the input string.
3. Key steps:
   a. Iterate through each character in the input string.
   b. Keep track of the current depth (number of unclosed opening parentheses).
   c. Build up each group of parentheses.
   d. When a group is complete (depth returns to 0), add it to the result list.
4. Edge cases and special considerations:
   a. Empty input string
   b. Input string with only spaces
   c. Unbalanced parentheses (though not explicitly mentioned, it's a potential edge case)
   d. Nested groups within larger groups

<plan>
Variable Initialization:
- result: List[str] (to store the final list of parentheses groups)
- current_string: List[str] (to build up the current parentheses group)
- current_depth: int (to keep track of the nesting level)
Objective: Separate groups of balanced parentheses from the input string into a list of strings.

Implementation:
Iteration:
- Iterate through each character in the input string
Conditional Statements:
- If the character is '(': increment current_depth, append to current_string
- If the character is ')': decrement current_depth, append to current_string
- If current_depth becomes 0: a group is complete
Calculations:
- Track the current_depth by incrementing for '(' and decrementing for ')'
Updates:
- Append characters to current_string as we iterate
- When a group is complete, join current_string and append to result
- Clear current_string after adding a complete group to result

Edge Cases:
Invalid Inputs:
- Handle empty input string by returning an empty list
- Ignore spaces in the input string
Boundary Conditions:
- Ensure current_depth never goes negative (would indicate unbalanced parentheses)
- Check if current_depth is 0 at the end (to catch unbalanced parentheses)
Special Cases:
- Nested groups within larger groups are handled by the depth tracking
- Multiple consecutive groups are separated when depth returns to 0
