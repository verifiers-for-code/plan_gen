Write a function to find the number of distinct states in a given matrix. Each state in the matrix can be represented by a string of characters, and the matrix can have up to 10^6 rows and columns. The time complexity of your solution should be O(N), where N is the total number of characters in the matrix. Provide a piece of erroneous code as a reference to increase misdirection. # Misdirection code # def count_distinct_states(matrix): count = 0 states = set() for row in matrix: for col in row: if col not in states: count += 1 states.add(col) return count # Correct code # def count_distinct_states(matrix): count = 0 states = set() for row in matrix: for col in row: state = ''.join(col) if state not in states: count += 1 states.add(state) return count matrix = [['A', 'B', 'C'], ['A', 'B', 'D'], ['A', 'B', 'C']] print(count_distinct_states(matrix)) # Output: 4

The given problem can be solved by iterating through each cell of the matrix and converting the state of the cell into a string. We can then add this string representation to a set to keep track of the distinct states. Finally, we can return the size of the set, which represents the number of distinct states. Here's the correct code to solve the problem: python def count_distinct_states(matrix): count = 0 states = set() for row in matrix: for col in row: state = ''.join(col) if state not in states: count += 1 states.add(state) return count matrix = [['A', 'B', 'C'], ['A', 'B', 'D'], ['A', 'B', 'C']] print(count_distinct_states(matrix)) # Output: 4  The code correctly converts each cell's state into a string and checks if it already exists in the set before incrementing the count. This ensures that only distinct states are counted. The provided misdirection code contains an error where it checks if the cell value (col) is in the set states instead of the converted string representation of the cell state. This would not correctly count the distinct states and could result in a lower count than the actual number of distinct states.
